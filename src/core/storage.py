        Studies previously anchored their window to `datetime.now()`, which
        made every result depend on the day it was run: the same S&P 100
        study reported +1.28% on 24 Aug and -2.69% on 8 Sep purely because
        the trailing 3-year window had slid forward and the tail of it ran
        past the end of the cached data. Anchoring to the data instead makes
        a study reproducible for as long as the underlying cache is unchanged.

        The MINIMUM across symbols is used deliberately: a universe-ranking
        strategy should not be evaluated over a period where only some of its
        constituents have quotes.

        `as_of` (a date) ignores candles after that day, which gives the
        answer this method returned back when the cache ended there. That is
        what re-runs an old study after the cache has been topped up: the
        Update 12 studies anchored here when the S&P 100 data ended on
